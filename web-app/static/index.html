                This view shows the data flows at every step of the adselection. It start off with the total unfiltered
                insights sent by social medias to users. This then shows which insights were selected by users. Then a
                website "generates" traffic and connects a user with an ad. Several ads are considered for the
                selection, but most fail to match the requirements of the users and the website. Finally an advert is
                selected

                which can be seen as buttons once the page has been reloaded.
